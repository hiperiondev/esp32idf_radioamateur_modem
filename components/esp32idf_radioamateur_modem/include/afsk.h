 * @brief ESP-IDF hardware abstraction layer for the AFSK modem.
 * @details
 * This module drives the analog front end of the modem in full duplex mode:
 *  - RX path: ADC1 running in continuous (DMA) mode, free running and never
 *    stopped, so incoming audio is always being sampled.
 *  - TX path: the internal DAC running in one-shot mode, fed sample by sample
 *    from a GPTimer interrupt service routine at ::MODEM_DAC_SAMPLERATE.
 *
 * On the ESP32, the continuous ADC driver and the continuous (DMA) DAC driver
 * both require exclusive use of the I2S0 peripheral, so they can never be
 * active at the same time. Driving the DAC from an independent GPTimer instead
 * of the DMA DAC path leaves I2S0 entirely to the ADC, which allows both
 * directions to run simultaneously. This is what makes a simple wire between
 * GPIO25 and GPIO35 usable as a working full-duplex self-test loop.
