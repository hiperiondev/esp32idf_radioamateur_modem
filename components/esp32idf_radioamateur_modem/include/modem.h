 *        ratio, rather than the nominal ::MODEM_ADC_SAMPLERATE /

 *
 * The DAC (transmit) and ADC (receive) sample clocks are two independent
 * timers, each with its own rounding error against the rate it was asked
 * for - see the ::MODEM_ADC_SAMPLERATE and dac_timer_create() comments.
 * Every profile's PLL step is computed from the *nominal* ratio of those two
 * rates (see PLL1200_STEP / PLL9600_STEP / PLL300_STEP in modem.c), so any
 * gap between nominal and real is a steady-state error the DPLL has to
 * track for the rest of a transmission instead of being told about up
 * front. For G3RUH at 9600 Bd and only 8 ADC samples per symbol, that gap
 * is the dominant remaining source of the frame loss characterised in
 * afsk_loopback_test.c's stress test.
 *
 * This does not require live measurement of both clocks: the DAC alarm rate
 * (::afskGetDacAlarmRate()) is already known exactly from the timer's
 * configuration, and only the ADC side needs to be measured (see
 * ::modem_measure_adc_rate()). Call this once, after both the ADC and the
 * DAC timer are running but before the first ::ModemInit() (i.e. before the
 * first ::afskSetModem()) - modem_init() does this automatically. The
 * result is stored and reapplied on every subsequent profile switch, so it
 * only needs to be measured once per boot: both clocks are derived from the
 * same crystal, so their ratio is a fixed board property, not something
 * that drifts run to run.
