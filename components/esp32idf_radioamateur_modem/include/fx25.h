 * @brief FX.25 forward-error-correction (FEC) framing on top of AX.25.
 *
 * @note FX.25 requires the Reed-Solomon codec (rs.h / rs.c from VP-Digi),
 *       which was NOT included in the archive this component was ported
 *       from. The declarations and logic below are ported and ready to use,
 *       but remain disabled until rs.h/rs.c are added to this component and
 *       the build is compiled with -DENABLE_FX25.
