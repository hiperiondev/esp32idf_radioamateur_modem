 *
 * This was 38400 and that is what held G3RUH to 3/5 frames. 38400 gives the
 * 9600 Bd profile exactly FOUR ADC samples per symbol, and the demodulator's
 * timing recovery cannot work with four: its sample instant is quantised to one
 * ADC period (25 % of a symbol) and decode()'s three-sample majority vote spans
 * 75 % of a symbol, so the vote window always reaches into a transition. Host
 * simulation of the real modem.c, with both real clocks and the measured
 * analogue path and NO noise, produces hard bit errors at every sampling phase
 * where the ADC instants line up with the DAC's update instants - and since the
 * two clocks differ by ~0.05 %, the alignment walks through those phases every
 * ~55 ms, several times per transmission. At 76800 the same simulation gives
 * zero bit errors at every phase and with up to 30 us of TX edge jitter.
 *
 * The AFSK profiles never cared: they are demodulated at 9600 Hz through a
 * correlator after decimation, so they see no baseband edge to mis-sample, and
 * they measure identically at either rate (verified on the host).
 *
 * Constraints: at least 20 kHz and at most 2 MHz (SOC_ADC_SAMPLE_FREQ_THRES_LOW
 * / _HIGH on this chip), and an exact integer multiple of 9600. The cost of the
 * change is that the RX DSP runs on twice as many samples and
 * ::MODEM_RESAMPLE_RATIO becomes 8, which needs the longer decimation FIR in
 * afsk.c - an 8-tap filter cut for a 4:1 ratio does not anti-alias a 8:1 one.
 *
 * The DAC rate is deliberately NOT changed with it. The transmitter puts symbol
 * edges exactly on DAC samples whatever the rate; it is the receiver that needed
 * the resolution.

/**
 * @brief Size, in samples, of one ADC DMA conversion frame.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT ::MODEM_BLOCK_SIZE, and the difference is worth
 * a paragraph because getting it wrong costs G3RUH every other frame.
 *
 * The IDF's own ADC ISR (adc_dma_intr() in esp_adc/adc_continuous.c) hands
 * each finished frame to a FreeRTOS ring buffer with:
 *
 *      xRingbufferSendFromISR(ringbuf_hdl, finished_buffer, finished_size, ...)
 *
 * and xRingbufferSendFromISR() does its memcpy() - all `finished_size` bytes
 * of it - plus a task unblock inside portENTER_CRITICAL_ISR(). On Xtensa that
 * raises PS.INTLEVEL to XCHAL_EXCM_LEVEL, which is 3. The DAC sample clock is
 * a level 3 interrupt (see AFSK_init()), so it is MASKED for the whole copy.
 * No amount of IRAM_ATTR on our side changes that: the code doing the blocking
 * is the driver's, it is already in IRAM, and it is simply long.
 *
 * The freeze length is therefore the frame size, near enough linearly:
 *
 *      768 samples = 1536 B  ->  ~11 us   (10 % of a 9600 Bd symbol: fatal)
 *      128 samples =  256 B  ->  ~2 us    (2 % of a symbol: inside budget)
 *
 * At 1200 Bd an 11 us displacement is 1.3 % of a symbol and invisible, which
 * is exactly why every AFSK profile passed while G3RUH dropped frames and
 * stage 2 of the diagnostics blamed a flash fetch that was not there.
 *
 * Making this smaller costs only ISR entries (128 samples at 38400 Hz is one
 * every 3.3 ms instead of every 20 ms) and buys back the symbol edge. The DSP
 * is unaffected: AFSK_Poll() still consumes whole ::MODEM_BLOCK_SIZE blocks
 * out of the FIFO, which is what the FIFO is for.
 *
 * Constraints: must be EVEN (the ESP32 DMA pair-swap un-doing in adc_ingest()
 * works within a frame), must make conv_frame_size a multiple of
 * SOC_ADC_DIGI_DATA_BYTES_PER_CONV, and must divide ::MODEM_BLOCK_SIZE so a
 * whole number of frames makes a block.
