 * 2. THRES - threshold of the DCD pulse counter. When reached, the input signal
 *    is assumed valid. Higher values mean more noise immunity but a slower DCD set.
 * 3. The MAXPULSE/THRES difference sets the DCD "inertia".
 * 4. INC is added when a symbol change happens near PLL counter zero.
 * 5. DEC is subtracted when a symbol change happens too far from zero.

 *
 * N9600 was 1 (a zero step: dem->pll never advanced and decode() never sampled,
 * so the profile could not decode a single bit by construction), then 4, which
 * at least ran. 4 was still wrong, and it is the whole reason G3RUH sat at 3/5
 * frames while every AFSK profile did 5/5.
 *
 * 4 samples per symbol does not give this timing-recovery design enough to work
 * with. The DPLL's sample instant is quantised to one ADC sample - 25 % of a
 * symbol at N=4 - and the majority vote in decode() spans three of them, i.e.
 * 75 % of a symbol, so the vote window necessarily reaches into a transition.
 * Measured on the host against the real modulator, with the analogue path and
 * both real clocks modelled and no noise at all: at N=4 the profile produces
 * hard bit errors at the sampling phases where the ADC instants coincide with
 * the DAC's update instants (2/8, 4/8 and 6/8 of a symbol), 1.4 % to 2.7 % BER
 * at those phases and 0 % between them. Since the DAC (38461.5 Hz) and the ADC
 * differ by ~0.05 %, the alignment walks through the bad phases every ~55 ms,
 * and a 350 ms transmission crosses them repeatedly. Hence "random" frame loss
 * of roughly 40 %, immune to every amount of TX jitter reduction.
 *
 * At N=8 - the same 8 samples per symbol the 1200 Bd profile has always had,
 * obtained by running the ADC at 76800 Hz - the same simulation gives ZERO bit
 * errors at every sampling phase and with up to 30 us of TX edge jitter. Nothing
 * else about the demodulator changes; it stops being starved of resolution.
 *
 * The vote window and the DPLL tune constants were both swept on the host first:
 * (win=3, shift=0) is already the best of its family and the tune surface is
 * chaotic (some settings collapse to 48 % BER), which is itself a sign the loop
 * is bistable at N=4. There is no tuning fix, only a resolution fix. */
